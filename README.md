This repository contains three Java programs developed during a 1-month virtual internship. Each program is designed to showcase different aspects of Java programming.

## Programs

### 1. Number Game (numbergame)

The `numbergame` program is an interactive game where users can guess a randomly generated number. It demonstrates basic input/output handling and random number generation in Java.

cd numbergame
javac NumberGame.java
java NumberGame

# 2. Quiz Application (quizapplication)
The quizapplication program is a simple quiz application that prompts users with questions and evaluates their answers. It demonstrates the use of arrays, loops, and conditional statements in Java.

How to Run:
cd quizapplication

java QuizApplication

# 3. Grade Calculator (gradecalculator)
The gradecalculator program is a utility for calculating grades based on student scores. It showcases the use of functions, input validation, and decision-making in Java.

How to Run:
cd gradecalculator
javac GradeCalculator.java
java GradeCalculator

Development Environment
All programs were developed using Java. Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system to compile and run these programs.
